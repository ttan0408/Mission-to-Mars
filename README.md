# Mission-to-Mars
Robin has a new project focusing on researching data about Mars and he is pretty excited about putting together web-scraping project. We are asked to help and we used all available tools included : Splinder (Automatic Web Browsing),  MongoDB, HTML Elements.

The initial web app presented to Robin is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, we have to go through these steps :
   
 ## 1 Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
 
  In this steps we are using Jupyter Notebooks to scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles. Using Jupyter Notebook will help us to test the initial code so that   we can use it for the automatic scraping . We were able to obtain the list of titles and images for Mars Hemisphere. The Jupyter Notebook is shown below :

 ## 2 Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
 
  In step 2, we have to make the process become automated . To do this we convert Jupyter Notebook code into scrap.py file and convert the jupyter code into hemisphere           function. In additional, we have to modified the index.html so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and   title for each hemisphere image. The result for this are shown below :
  
 
 
 ## 3 Add Bootstrap 3 Components
  Robin really impress with the web-app ,but she like to make it more stand out. To deliver this request we have to use the Bootstrap 3 components. We modified the index.html     so that the title "Mars Hemisphere" stand out with the format using jumbotron and h1. We also make the image display using thumpnail format with mixed: mobile and desktop of   col-md-3. The result for this are shown below :
