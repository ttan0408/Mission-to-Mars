# Mission-to-Mars
Robin has a new project focusing on researching data about Mars and he is pretty excited about putting together web-scraping project. We are asked to help and we used all available tools included : Splinder (Automatic Web Browsing),  MongoDB, HTML Elements.

The initial web app presented to Robin is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, we have to go through these steps :
   
 ## 1 Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
 
  In this steps we are using Jupyter Notebooks to scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles. Using Jupyter Notebook will help us to test the initial code so that   we can use it for the automatic scraping . 
 
 ## 2 Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
 ## 3 Add Bootstrap 3 Components

Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
